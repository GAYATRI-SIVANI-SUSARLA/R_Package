\title{Fit models using ensemble method}
\usage{
use_ensemble_fit(X, y, model_types, ntree)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of predictor variables.}

\item{y}{A vector of the response variable.}

\item{model_types}{A vector of character strings specifying the types of models to include in the ensemble.}

\item{ntree}{Optional; specifies the number of trees if a random forest is part of the ensemble.}
}
\value{
A list of models, each corresponding to a type specified in model_types.
}
\description{
This function fits an ensemble of different model types to the data. Each model type can contribute
differently to the final prediction, and ensemble methods can improve prediction accuracy and model robustness.
