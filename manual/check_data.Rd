\title{The \code{check_data} function validates and preprocesses predictor and response data for statistical modeling.
It ensures that the predictor matrix X is indeed a matrix, determines whether the response variable y is binary or continuous,
and optionally performs feature selection based on the correlation of predictors with the response variable.}
\usage{
check_data(X, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of predictor variables where each column represents a predictor and each row an observation.
The function will halt and raise an error if X is not a matrix.}

\item{y}{The response variable which can be either numeric, binary, or a factor with two levels. The function checks
if y is binary by assessing if it contains exactly two unique values (either in numeric or factor form) and
converts factors to numeric binary format if true. If y is not binary, it is treated as continuous.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
- \code{response_type}: A character string indicating if \code{y} is 'binary' or 'continuous'.
- \code{y}: The response variable, possibly transformed to numeric format if originally binary.
- \code{X}: The predictor matrix, potentially reduced to the top K predictors based on their correlation with \code{y}
if a prescreening condition is met and the user consents to prescreening.
}
\description{
The \code{check_data} function validates and preprocesses predictor and response data for statistical modeling.
It ensures that the predictor matrix X is indeed a matrix, determines whether the response variable y is binary or continuous,
and optionally performs feature selection based on the correlation of predictors with the response variable.
}
\details{
The function first verifies that X is a matrix. It then checks the type of y and sets the response type accordingly.
If the number of predictors in X exceeds the number of observations (rows), the function offers the user the option to
perform prescreening to select the top K most informative predictors. This prescreening involves calculating the
absolute correlation of each predictor with y, ordering them, and selecting the top K. This feature selection is
intended to mitigate issues like overfitting or model complexity in high-dimensional datasets.
}
\note{
The function requires user interaction when prescreening is applicable. It will stop execution with an error message if
the input types are incorrect or if invalid responses are provided during the interaction. Proper error handling is
included to guide correct usage.
