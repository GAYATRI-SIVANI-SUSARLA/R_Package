\title{Fit models using various methods including single, bagging, and ensemble approaches.}
\usage{
fitModel(
  X,
  y,
  model_type = NULL,
  bagging = FALSE,
  ensemble = FALSE,
  R = 100,
  model_types = NULL,
  ntree = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A matrix of predictor variables where each column is a predictor and each row an observation.}

\item{y}{A vector of the response variable corresponding to observations in X.}

\item{model_type}{A character string specifying the type of single model to fit when not using ensemble.
Valid inputs: 'linear', 'logistic', 'ridge', 'lasso', 'elastic_net', 'randomForest'.
This parameter is ignored if ensemble is TRUE.}

\item{bagging}{A logical indicating whether bagging should be applied. If TRUE, the specified model_type is used
to fit multiple models on bootstrap samples. This parameter is ignored if ensemble is TRUE.}

\item{ensemble}{A logical indicating whether an ensemble of different model types should be used. If TRUE,
model_types must be provided, and model_type must be NULL.}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap replicates for the bagging process. Only relevant if bagging is TRUE.}

\item{model_types}{An optional vector of model types to use in the ensemble. Required and must not be NULL
if ensemble is TRUE.}

\item{ntree}{The number of trees to be used in the Random Forest model, applicable only if 'randomForest'
is specified in model_type or included in model_types.}
}
\value{
Depending on the configuration, the function returns:
- A single model object if neither bagging nor ensemble is used.
- A list of model objects if bagging is used.
- A list of model objects from different types if ensemble is used.
}
\description{
This function provides a flexible interface for fitting different statistical and machine learning models
to a dataset. It supports fitting single models, multiple models with bagging, or a combination of models
with an ensemble approach.
}
\note{
It is essential to ensure that the provided X is a non-empty matrix and y is a non-empty vector.
The function performs a data check and will stop if inputs do not meet the requirements or if
the configuration of parameters is invalid, such as specifying both model_type and ensemble or
attempting to use both bagging and ensemble simultaneously.

\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 10), ncol = 10)
y <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)
model_lin <- fitModel(X, y, model_type = "linear")
model_bag <- fitModel(X, y, model_type = "linear", bagging = TRUE, R = 50)
model_ens <- fitModel(X, y, ensemble = TRUE, model_types = c("linear", "ridge"))
